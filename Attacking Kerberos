### Step-by-step solution for attacking Kerberos

### Enumeration with Kerbrute
Use Kerbrute to enumerate valid Active Directory users by abusing Kerberos pre-Authentication

1.  Install Kerbrute ---> https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases
2.  For Linux - make sure your attack box ip and DNS domain name are added in the /etc/hosts file or attacks won't work
      echo <ip> <controller> >> /etc/hosts (example: echo 10.10.123.456 CONTROLLER.local >> /etc/hosts)
3.  Make sure you have a list of usernames available to enumerate through (example: we will use one called User.txt) 
4.  Run ---> ./Kerbrute --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local User.txt
